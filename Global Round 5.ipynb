    "Another Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered n participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant i is ai. These rating changes are perfectly balanced — their sum is equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared semi-rated. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two conditions though:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each participant i, their modified rating change bi must be integer, and as close to ai2 as possible. It means that either bi=⌊ai2⌋ or bi=⌈ai2⌉. In particular, if ai is even, bi=ai2. Here ⌊x⌋ denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than x, and ⌈x⌉ denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than x.\n",
