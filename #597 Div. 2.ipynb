    "Consider the set of all nonnegative integers: 0,1,2,…. Given two integers a and b (1≤a,b≤104). We paint all the numbers in increasing number first we paint 0, then we paint 1, then 2 and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each number is painted white or black. We paint a number i according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "if i=0, it is colored white;\n",
    "if i≥a and i−a is colored white, i is also colored white;\n",

    "In this way, each nonnegative integer gets one of two colors.\n",

    "It is also possible that there are only finitely many nonnegative integers colored black. For example, when a=1 and b=10, then there is no nonnegative integer colored black at all.\n",
    "Your task is to determine whether or not the number of nonnegative integers colored black is infinite.\n",

    "Otherwise, print \"Finite\". To show that this is correct, we will prove that any integer greater than ab is colored white. Let x be an integer greater than ab. Consider the set S={x,x−a,x−2a,…,x−(b−1)a}. If, for any y∈S, y is divisible by b, we are done. Otherwise, by the pigeonhole principle, there exists distinct x−sa,x−ta∈S such that they have the same remainder when divided by b, thus b divides (x−sa)−(x−ta)=a(t−s). WLOG, let s<t. Thus, 0<t−s and b divides t−s, since gcd(a,b)=1. But t−s≤t<b. However, it is not possible for b to divide any integer x such that 0<x<b, thus we arrive at a contradiction."
